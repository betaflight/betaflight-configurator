The pre-defined properties are listed in this documentation as\n * 'Observable Properties', and have their own accessors; for example,\n * {@link module:ol/Map~Map} has a `target` property, accessed with\n * `getTarget()` and changed with `setTarget()`. Not all properties are however\n * settable. There are also general-purpose accessors `get()` and `set()`. For\n * example, `get('target')` is equivalent to `getTarget()`.\n *\n * The `set` accessors trigger a change event, and you can monitor this by\n * registering a listener. For example, {@link module:ol/View~View} has a\n * `center` property, so `view.on('change:center', function(evt) {...});` would\n * call the function whenever the value of the center property changes. Within\n * the function, `evt.target` would be the view, so `evt.target.getCenter()`\n * would return the new center.\n *\n * You can add your own observable properties with\n * `object.set('prop', 'value')`, and retrieve that with `object.get('prop')`.\n * You can listen for changes on that property value with\n * `object.on('change:prop', listener)`. You can get a list of all\n * properties with {@link module:ol/Object~BaseObject#getProperties}.\n *\n * Note that the observable properties are separate from standard JS properties.\n * You can, for example, give your map object a title with\n * `map.title='New title'` and with `map.set('title', 'Another title')`. The\n * first will be a `hasOwnProperty`; the second will appear in\n * `getProperties()`. Only the second is observable.\n *\n * Properties can be deleted by using the unset method.

You can use the full build supplied by\n * Proj4js, or create a custom build to support those projections you need; see\n * the Proj4js website for how to do this. You also need the Proj4js definitions\n * for the required projections. These definitions can be obtained from\n * https://epsg.io/, and are a JS function, so can be loaded in a script\n * tag (as in the examples) or pasted into your application.\n *\n * After all required projection definitions are added to proj4's registry (by\n * using `proj4.defs()`), simply call `register(proj4)` from the `ol/proj/proj4`\n * package. Existing transforms are not changed by this function. See\n * examples/wms-image-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Additional projection definitions can be registered with `proj4.defs()` any\n * time. Just make sure to call `register(proj4)` again; for example, with user-supplied data where you don't\n * know in advance what projections are needed, you can initially load minimal\n * support and then load whichever are requested.\n *\n * Note that Proj4js does not support projection extents. If you want to add\n * one for creating default tile grids, you can add it after the Projection\n * object has been created with `setExtent`, for example,\n * `get('EPSG:1234').setExtent(extent)`.\n *\n * In addition to Proj4js support, any transform functions can be added with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. To use this, you must first create\n * a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} object for the new projection and add it with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}. You can then add the forward and inverse\n * functions with {@link module:ol/proj~addCoordinateTransforms}. See\n * examples/wms-custom-proj for an example of this.\n *\n * Note that if no transforms are needed and you only need to define the\n * projection, just add a {@link module:ol/proj/Projection} with\n * {@link module:ol/proj~addProjection}.

Each state has a corresponding getter and setter, e.g.\n * `getCenter` and `setCenter` for the `center` state.\n *\n * An View has a `projection`. The projection determines the\n * coordinate system of the center, and its units determine the units of the\n * resolution (projection units per pixel). The default projection is\n * Spherical Mercator (EPSG:3857).\n *\n * ### The constraints\n *\n * `setCenter`, `setResolution` and `setRotation` can be used to change the\n * states of the view. Any value can be passed to the setters. And the value\n * that is passed to a setter will effectively be the value set in the view,\n * and returned by the corresponding getter.\n *\n * But a View object also has a *resolution constraint*, a\n * *rotation constraint* and a *center constraint*.\n *\n * As said above, no constraints are applied when the setters are used to set\n * new states for the view. Applying constraints is done explicitly through\n * the use of the `constrain*` functions (`constrainResolution` and\n * `constrainRotation` and `constrainCenter`).\n *\n * The main users of the constraints are the interactions and the\n * controls. For example, double-clicking on the map changes the view to\n * the \"next\" resolution. And releasing the fingers after pinch-zooming\n * snaps to the closest resolution (with an animation).\n *\n * The *resolution constraint* snaps to specific resolutions. It is\n * determined by the following options: `resolutions`, `maxResolution`,\n * `maxZoom`, and `zoomFactor`. If `resolutions` is set, the other three\n * options are ignored.

For a map to render, a view,\n * one or more layers, and a target container are needed:\n *\n *     import Map from 'ol/Map';\n *     import View from 'ol/View';\n *     import TileLayer from 'ol/layer/Tile';\n *     import OSM from 'ol/source/OSM';\n *\n *     var map = new Map({\n *       view: new View({\n *         center: [0, 0],\n *         zoom: 1\n *       }),\n *       layers: [\n *         new TileLayer({\n *           source: new OSM()\n *         })\n *       ],\n *       target: 'map'\n *     });\n *\n * The above snippet creates a map using a {@link module:ol/layer/Tile} to\n * display {@link module:ol/source/OSM~OSM} OSM data and render it to a DOM\n * element with the id `map`.\n *\n * The constructor places a viewport container (with CSS class name\n * `ol-viewport`) in the target element (see `getViewport()`), and then two\n * further elements within the viewport: one with CSS class name\n * `ol-overlaycontainer-stopevent` for controls and some overlays, and one with\n * CSS class name `ol-overlaycontainer` for other overlays (see the `stopEvent`\n * option of {@link module:ol/Overlay~Overlay} for the difference). The map\n * itself is placed in a further element within the viewport.\n *\n * Layers are stored as a {@link module:ol/Collection~Collection} in\n * layerGroups. A top-level group is provided by the library. This is what is\n * accessed by `getLayerGroup` and `setLayerGroup`. Layers entered in the\n * options are added to this group, and `addLayer` and `removeLayer` change the\n * layer collection in the group. `getLayers` is a convenience function for\n * `getLayerGroup().getLayers()`. Note that {@link module:ol/layer/Group~Group}\n * is a subclass of {@link module:ol/layer/Base}, so layers entered in the\n * options or added with `addLayer` can be groups, which can contain further\n * groups, and so on.\n *\n * @fires import(\"./MapBrowserEvent.js\").MapBrowserEvent\n * @fires import(\"./MapEvent.js\").MapEvent\n * @fires module:ol/render/Event~RenderEvent#postcompose\n * @fires module:ol/render/Event~RenderEvent#precompose\n * @api\n */\nvar Map = /*@__PURE__*/(function (PluggableMap) {\n  function Map(options) {\n    options = assign({}, options);\n    if (!options.controls) {\n      options.controls = defaultControls();\n    }\n    if (!options.interactions) {\n      options.interactions = defaultInteractions();\n    }\n\n    PluggableMap.call(this, options);\n  }\n\n  if ( PluggableMap ) Map.__proto__ = PluggableMap;\n  Map.prototype = Object.create( PluggableMap && PluggableMap.prototype );\n  Map.prototype.constructor = Map;\n\n  Map.prototype.createRenderer = function createRenderer () {\n    var renderer = new CanvasMapRenderer(this);\n    renderer.registerLayerRenderers([\n      CanvasImageLayerRenderer,\n      CanvasTileLayerRenderer,\n      CanvasVectorLayerRenderer,\n      CanvasVectorTileLayerRenderer\n    ]);\n    return renderer;\n  };\n\n  return Map;\n}(PluggableMap));\n\n\nexport default Map;\n\n//# sourceMappingURL=Map.js.map","/**\n * @module ol/OverlayPositioning\n */\n\n/**\n * Overlay position: `'bottom-left'`, `'bottom-center'`,  `'bottom-right'`,\n * `'center-left'`, `'center-center'`, `'center-right'`, `'top-left'`,\n * `'top-center'`, `'top-right'`\n * @enum {string}\n */\nexport default {\n  BOTTOM_LEFT: 'bottom-left',\n  BOTTOM_CENTER: 'bottom-center',\n  BOTTOM_RIGHT: 'bottom-right',\n  CENTER_LEFT: 'center-left',\n  CENTER_CENTER: 'center-center',\n  CENTER_RIGHT: 'center-right',\n  TOP_LEFT: 'top-left',\n  TOP_CENTER: 'top-center',\n  TOP_RIGHT: 'top-right'\n};\n\n//# sourceMappingURL=OverlayPositioning.js.map","/**\n * @module ol/Overlay\n */\nimport MapEventType from './MapEventType.js';\nimport BaseObject, {getChangeEventType} from './Object.js';\nimport OverlayPositioning from './OverlayPositioning.js';\nimport {CLASS_SELECTABLE} from './css.js';\nimport {removeNode, removeChildren, outerWidth, outerHeight} from './dom.js';\nimport {listen, unlistenByKey} from './events.js';\nimport {containsExtent} from './extent.js';\n\n\n/**\n * @typedef {Object} Options\n * @property {number|string} [id] Set the overlay id.
